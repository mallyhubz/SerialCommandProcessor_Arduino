A basic BETA library to take serial commands and action them

**See `SerialCommands.ino` for an working example.**

**Compile with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.**

I tested the example(s) with Elegoo (Arduino-like) Uno R3. The code should work for other platforms as well. 
Please report if something is not working.
